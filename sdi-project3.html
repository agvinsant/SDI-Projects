<article>
<p>In this project I will continue the day in my life by taking you with me to work at California Pizza Kitchen in Estero, FL.</p>
<p>I will go through a list of front of the house staff and managers and how many it takes to run the dining room, as well as other aspects of our day serving people.
</p>
<p>In this project, the servers are having a contest for selling desserts. I take you through the sales results for Monday and Tuesday. </p>
