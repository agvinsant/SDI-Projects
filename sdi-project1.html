	<p>Hello Everyone! There is not a better story to tell that shows personal involvement than a story about my daily life. </p>
	<p>I am a father of two kids and a server at a high end corporate restaurant, California Pizza Kitchen. Now at the moment, my kids are out for summer vacation, so I will take you through a day during the school year. I will take you from the time we wake up to the time I have to go to work.</p>
	<p>Now I know that it is not the most interesting story to tell, but for the purpose of this course and learning a new language, it will work. This is why I chose my theme of a day in my life. </p>
