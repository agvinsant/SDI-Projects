<p>It's almost the end of the class! I have learned a ton. Thanks to all the instructors for your help!</p>
<p>This project runs from two different .js files. One is the main assignment file which houses the function calls from my second file, my library.</p>
<p>You told me to research, and research I did. MDN was a big help but was also very complicated, especially when I was trying to learn the regEx. I found many other useful sites and blogs by using Google.</p>
<p>Being that I am pretty happy with my progression of this course and my grades, I just did the required six function due to the learning curve and time restraints.</p>
