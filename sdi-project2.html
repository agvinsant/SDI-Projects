<p>Hello again!</p><p>This is a continuation of my story from last week's assignment, but in more detail.</p>
<p>This will take you through the general start to an average day in the life of myself and my family.
I will start with getting the kids off to school and what happens next, whether I go back to bed or stay up, what I eat for breakfast, and more.</p>
<p>This time I will discuss further the decisions I make and how I make them, except all encoded!</p>
